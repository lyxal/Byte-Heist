    <h1>Byte Heist</h1>
    <p>Byte Heist is a site where you can test your coding skills by solving challenges in as few bytes as possible.</p>
    <p>
      The site will be similar to sites like code.golf, anarchy golf, and the late week.golf. Some unique features will include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Challenges will have a finite run time, probably around 6 months. After this time all solutions will be made public.
      </li>
      <li>
        A highly customizable judging system that will allow things like restricted source challenges, alternate scoring systems, self referential challenges etc. Though I also
        hope to have a good selection of basic code golf challenges too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Easily upload and collaborate on challenges via the interface. Built in ways to vote on challenges, give feedback, suggest test cases etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        There will be curated challenges that contribute to a global leaderboard, but you can also create private challenges to play with your friends,
        or to use for C.M.C.s etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Right now there are already a few challenges you can try. Many things are incomplete. Expect the database to be wiped before 1.0.
    </p>
